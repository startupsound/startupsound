                        As a bass, Matt Barr frightens easily when presented with things like full words or notes above a low F.
                        He's always eager to offer insight and assistance if the group is in danger of staying on task for more than five minutes at a time.
                        At 6'4" he's probably the member of the group that's most looked up to.
                        A web developer in the daytime, Matt Barr is a ridiculously avid gamer in the evenings from <strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong> to <strong>League of Legends</strong>.
                        Matt Barr firmly believes that the greatest trick the devil ever played on the world was making it so that when you bite your cheek it swells up so that you end up biting it again 12 more times.

                        If you've been to any of our performances, you may recognize Ian as the one off to the side laying down the sick beats.
                        He also arranges many of the a cappella covers that the Acoustix sing on stage.
                        Ian works 11-to-7 as a software engineer, but he prefers to spend his nights and weekends playing video games, exploring the mountains (on foot or on skis), learning new music, and watching way too much Netflix.
                        When he's not singing or spitting into a microphone, Ian loves to improvise on the keyboard and violin.
